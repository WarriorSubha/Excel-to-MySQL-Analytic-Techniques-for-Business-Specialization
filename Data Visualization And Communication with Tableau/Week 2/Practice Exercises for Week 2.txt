# Summary
Variables:Dog ID, User ID, Country, State, Sign in Count, Filter.
Mark Down: Details, Text
a) How many unique dogs are in the dataset (Indicated by the number of unique entires in Dog ID)?
b) How many unique (human) users are in the dataset (indicated by the number of unique entries in User ID)?

##Tableau
Columns:
Rows: Sign in Count
Filters: Dog ID (Group): Other "Other box is checked off"
DetaiL: Dog ID
Color: Dog ID (group)

## Comments:
Dog IDs with Sign in Count of above 175 are grouped and filtered out to exclude these outliers.

# How to Filter to get Dog ID Group :
1. On The Axis set 175 as the minimum value
2. Select all the outliers
3. Right Click and select Group option

### Notes:
I was able to get around this issue by putting sign in count on rows, Dog ID on detail, 
and then right clicking on the axis --> edit axis --> fixed --> select 0 - 175.
once the axis is restricted then I manually drag selected (hold left click) data and made a group. 
Then i could put this dog id group in the filter card and it works.

#Summary
Variables: Total Tests Completed, Breed Type, Breed Group, Dimension. 
Markdown:
a) Identify the features of dogs or their ownwers that have correlated with increased completion socres in the past.
b) We will focus on examining features of dogs that correlate with differences in the number of tests the dogs complete.
c) How aspects of dogs personalities and breed types affect completion metrics

##Tableau
Columns:Breed Type
Rows: Breed Type Median(Total Tests Complete)
Filters: Dog ID (Group) : Other; Breed Type Select [Cross Breed, Mixed Breed/Other, Popular Hybrid, Pure Breed]

## Comments:
Median Total Tests Completed for all Breed Types is 7. Is this correct?

## Anaylsis:
1.I found that average total tests completed were very similar across breed types:
2. Then I found that except for Pure Breeds, the overwhelming majority of entries is missing a breed group label:

#Summary
Variables: DNA tested, Dog Fixed, Total Tests Completed, Breed Type, Dog Fixed, DNA Tested, Total Tests Completed
Markdown:
a) to confirm whether or not the dog is pure-bred?
b) because they are really interested in finding out more about where their dog came from?

##Tableau
Columns: Breed Group
Rows: MEDIAN(Total Test Complete), CNTD(Dog ID)
Filters: Dog ID (Group): Other, Breed Group [Herding, Hound, Non-Sporting, Sporting, Terrier, Toy, Working], Dog ID [Other)

## Comments:
This bar chart shows the median Total Tests Completed for DNA Tested broken down by Dog Fixed.
The median Total Tests Completed is highest for dogs which are DNA tested but not spayed/neutered, 
which supports the hypothesis that owners which intend to breed their digs may be more interested 
in the personality of their dogs than other owners.

## Analysis 
"Owners who intend to breed their dogs might be more interested in the personality of their dogs than others 
(because they will be interested in whether they are breeding a certain kind of temperament)."

It is impossible to breed a dog if the dog is fixed or neutered. If the above hypothesis is true, on average non-fixed dogs 
should complete more tests than fixed dogs, since the owners of non-fixed might be more interested in the personality of their dogs. 
However, this is not the case.

On average, fixed dogs completed more tests than non-fixed dogs. I think that the reason fixed dogs completed more tests could be that 
(1) fixed dogs have stabler moods; 2) the owners of fixed dogs want their dogs to focus on them instead of things that 
non-fixed dogs could do; 3) fixed dogs have better focus.

#Summary
Variables: Dog ID, Country, Total Tets Completed, Show Me 
Markdown:
a) whether particular countries and/or states within the US have more Dognition customers than others?
b) whether customers within specific geographic regions are more likely to complete more tests?

##Tableau
Columns: Country
Rows: MEDIAN(Total Tets Complete) CNTD(Dog ID)
Filters: Dog ID(group): Other [select other], CNTD(Dog ID)[ 30, 10,262], Country [AU, CA, DE, DK, FR, GB, NO, NZ, US]
Color: Country

## Comments:
The charts show the median of Total Tests Completed and distinct count of Dog ID for each Country. 
The distinct count of Dog ID filter includes values greater than or equal to 30. 
Out of these countries, Germany, Denmark, Norway and New Zealand have higher median Total Tests Completed than the US.

## Analysis
"As a point of discussion, how can you use the information from these geographic analyses to make a recommendation about a 
geographical market Dognition should either nurture or move more into?"

The U.S. is Dognition's major market. Runners-up include Canada, Australia, Great Britain. 
These countries have the most Dognition customers. The result is not surprising given the facts that (1) U.S. is Dognition's home turf; 
(2) Canada, Australia and Great Britain are famous dog-friendly countries.

In terms of marketing and long-term business strategy, wile it is of Dognition's interest to continue focusing on the above geographical 
markets, it may also want to expand more into other dog-friendly countries, such as France, Norway and Luxembourg. 
Logic: If people love dogs, wouldn't they be more interested in their dogs' temperament?

# Summary
Variables: Median ITI, Mean ITI, Dog ID, Total Tests Completed
a) We will throw out some data from dogs who completed 20 or more tests
b) Our analyses will be biased towards dogs who do not complete all the Dognition Assessments tests, which might not translate
well do dogs who do finish the Dogntion Assessment tets.

##Tableau
Columns: Total Tests Completed
Rows: Mean ITI(minutes) MedianITI(minutes)
Filters: Dog ID(group)[Other checked off]: Other, Total Tests Completed [1,19], Mean ITI(minutes)

## Show Trend Lines
1. Right Click
2. Scroll down to Trend Lines
3. Select Show Trend Lines

## Comments:
The trend lines or Mean ITI and Median ITI go in opposite directions.
The median is less affected by outliers, the Median ITI trend line supports the hypothesis that 
customers who complete tests more quickly are more likely to complete more tests.

## Analysis
"In this exercise, we are going to try to assess the hypothesis that customers who complete tests quickly are more likely to 
complete more tests overall."

There are some level of relations between Mean ITI (minutes) and Total Test Completed or Median ITI (minutes) and Total Test Completed, 
but the relations are not strong at all. Despite the significant p-values in both cases, R-squared in both cases are extremely low, 
indicating very little fluctuation (or change) in the number of tests completed can be explained by Median ITI or Mean ITI.

The following regressions have the outliers in Sign-In Count (those above 175) and dogs completed 20 or more tests filtered out. 
Outliers in Median ITI (minutes) and Mean ITI (minutes) are also filtered out.

Median ITI (minutes) vs. Total Test Completed (19 or less)

p-value is smaller than 0.0001, indicating statistical significance. However, R-squared is only 0.0084051, 
indicating that less than 1% of the fluctuation (or change) in number of tests completed is explained by the Median ITI (minutes)

Mean ITI (Minutes) vs. Total Tests Completed (19 or less)

p-value is smaller than 0.0001, indicating statistical significance. However, R-squared is only 0.0281518, indicating less than 3% of 
the variance in number of tests completed is explained by Mean ITI (minutes).

I think it is a good idea to build on previous knowledge and relate the above to Week 2's peer review project where we needed to 
build our own model.

In multivariate regressions, including statistically insignificant independent variables in the model can dilute model precision and 
thus result in low R-squared. However, in the case above, there is only one independent variable, Mean ITI (minutes) or Median ITI 
(minutes), that is statistically significant.

In response to hypothesis in the PDF file whether dogs completed tests more quickly are likely to complete more tests, the conclusion
is "No", based on the analysis of R-squared.

Sometimes, changing the type of regression will increase the model's predictive power, i.e., a higher R-squared. Take the case of 
Mean ITI (minutes) vs. Total Test Completed, a power regression DOES improve the fitness of the model.

p-value is still smaller than 0.0001, indicating statistical significance at a 95% confidence interval. R-squared is now increased 
to 0.257419, indicating that with power regression, about 26% of the variance in the number of tests completed is explained by
Mean ITI (minutes). R-squared is still low, because we are trying to establish a relation between two variables that have little 
relation in reality. However, it is a dramatic improve from linear regression and an example of how changing regression method can 
improve our model's predictive power. Sometimes, people are too constrained to just one type of regression. I mentioned this here
because this insight may be helpful if we need to build a model again in this course or this specialization. Why is this important? 
Imagine feeding the linear model into a machine vs. feeding the power model into a machine and have the machine predict the outcome 
and we prescribe remedies. The machine with the power model will be more accurate. The highest level of analytics, 
prescriptive analytics, is built upon predictive analytics.

One last note: the exercise PDF file says "put Total Tests Completed on the Columns shelf. Then put Median ITI and Mean ITI on 
the Rows shelf". I think it should be the other way around as I showed in the power regression above, since we want to know whether 
dogs who completed tests more quickly completed more tests, in other words, we want to know whether Mean ITI can predict number of
tests completed. Hence, Mean ITI is the independent variable and Number of Tests Completed is the dependent variable.
