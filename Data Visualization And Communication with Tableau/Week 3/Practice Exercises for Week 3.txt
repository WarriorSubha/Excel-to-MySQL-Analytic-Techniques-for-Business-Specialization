Exercise  1.
Questions: After which tets do users tend to drop off? Do they drop off in the middle of the tests within a subcategory, or at the
end of all the tests associated with a subcategory? what could this mean for Dognition?

#Tableau
Columns: Test Name
Rows: CNT(Number of Records)
Color: Test name

Commentary: observe the red arrows, at those points we see the highest number of test drops.

Exercise  2.
Questions: Do those hours change at different times during the week? What implications could this have for when you should send
reminders or advertisements to customers or pontential customers?

#Tableau
Column: HOUR(Time Correction)
Rows: SUM(Number of Records)
Filters: WEEKDAY(Time Correction)
"To aid in this, bring another copy of your (Corrected) Created At variable to the filter shelf"

Formula: DATEADD('hour',[Diff from UTC], [Created at])

Exercise  3.
Questions:  "Can you figure out how to set the advanced options so that the table calculation computes percentages separately 
for Free Start users vs non-Free Start users?"

# Show % of total for Free Start Users and Not Free Start Users separately.
*Go to "Analysis" then choose "percentage of" and check "Table".
*Then If needed: Right-click on your variable and choose "compute using"

#Tableau
Columns: Free Start User (group), Rank by DogID
Rows: CNTD(Dog ID), CNTD(Dog ID)
Filters: Exclude Test Data
Color: Free Start User
-->click on the second CNTD(DogID), choose Edit Table Calculation... from the drop down list. When the dialog box pops up, 
choose Specific Dimension and Rank by DogID.
-- > Edit % of Total Distinct count of Dog ID --> Set Axis to automatic

#Conclusion:
So, only 5.72% of free-starters finished the 20-question Assessment, while 29.14% of non-free-starters finished the 20-question 
Assessment. The marketing strategy of giving the first four assessment tests for free did not seem to motivate people to finish more
tests with their dogs.

Exercise  4.
Questions: Can you make a similar calculation that ranks the tests completed by each user, mimicking the information provided in Rank
by UserID? Can you figure out how to include both ranks in the same table?

Steps:
1. Created calculated field
a. RANK(ATTR([Created at]),'asc')
2. Drag Rank from Measures to Marks Detail
3. Edit table calculation
a. Computing using: Specific Dimensions with Test name and Created at
4. Drag Rank to Row shelf

#Tableau
Columns:
Rows: Dog ID, Test name, Rank (Created at) 
Text: Minute(Created at) 
-->Place Created At in Text. For level of details, select the Minute in the second block in the pop-up menu. I recommend selecting 
"Minute", since a lot of the tests were created during the same hour. If "Hour" is selected, ranking might not work.
--> Analysis click on Created Calculated Field...
--> Choose ascending, 'asc'. Otherwise, you would see the last test being ranked #1. Place the calculated field in Details. 
Click and choose Edit Table Calculation... Then, choose the following parameters: Specific Dimensions, Minute of Created At, Test Name.
--> Convert the calculated field to dimension by selecting Discrete.
--> Place the calculated field in the Rows shelf, behind Test Name.
